# InvestigationService: Master Context

## 1. Project Vision

We are building an **AI-powered Kubernetes Investigation Platform** that allows users to ask natural language questions about Kubernetes environments (e.g., "Why is payment-service crashing?") and receive structured, AI-generated investigation results.

### What Makes This Different

This is not just a tool runner. It is:

- **RAG-enhanced** – Context-aware reasoning
- **Multi-step AI reasoning** – Complex planning and execution
- **Deterministic execution-controlled** – Safe, auditable operations
- **Enterprise-safe investigation engine** – Production-ready

**Core Principle:** The LLM never directly executes infrastructure actions. All execution is controlled by a .NET layer.

## 3. Execution Flow

### User Query
```
"Why is payment-service crashing?"
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Frontend Request** – Streamlit sends request to .NET API
2. **API Processing** – Generates traceId, handles authentication
3. **AI Planning** – Orchestrator calls AI Agent
4. **Context & Planning** – AI Agent:
   - Uses RAG to retrieve relevant context
   - Calls LLM to generate execution plan
   - Returns structured plan to orchestrator
5. **Tool Execution** – Orchestrator executes tools via Tool Execution Service
6. **Result Collection** – Raw results collected from all tools
7. **AI Analysis** – Results sent back to AI Agent for analysis
8. **Diagnosis Generation** – LLM generates structured diagnosis
9. **Response** – Structured response returned to frontend

## 4. Core Architectural Principles

### 🔒 Principle 1: LLM Never Executes Infrastructure

- Agent proposes plans only
- .NET layer executes them
- All infrastructure access is validated and logged

### 🧠 Principle 2: AI is Intelligence Layer Only

AI Agent responsibilities:
- Planning and reasoning
- Context interpretation
- Summarization and insight generation
- Confidence assessment

### ⚙️ Principle 3: .NET Controls Execution

.NET layer responsibilities:
- Deterministic execution
- Input validation
- Retry policies (Polly)
- Observability (structured logging)
- Authorization (future RBAC)
- TraceId propagation end-to-end

### 📚 Principle 4: RAG Provides Context

- Used before planning to inform agent decisions
- Optionally used after execution for verification
- Ensures decisions are based on knowledge base

---

## 5. Tech Stack

### Backend (.NET)
- **.NET 8** with async/await support
- **Clean Architecture** – Separation of concerns
- **Minimal APIs** or Controllers
- **Kubernetes SDK** – Native cluster communication

## We have to work on this main context in future.
AFTER THIS (Do NOT Build Yet)
Once stable:
- Add RAG
- Add reflection loop
- Add confidence threshold re-planning
- Add policy engine
- Add streaming LLM responses
- Add OpenTelemetry spans
- But not now.

## To do
-After you stabilize:
-Phase 1 (Now)
-Single-pass planner
-Phase 2
-Add reflection loop (optional)
-Phase 3
-Add RAG knowledge retrieval
-Phase 4
-Add memory per caseId
-But first:
-Stabilize planner.
